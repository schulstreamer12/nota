# nota -The idea behind it
A simple File Editor with a Folderview

Yes that was the only idea I had when I get this project started.
I want a notepad, where you can organize your notes in folders, and it should be completley free from clouds-saving and etc.

# Good to know / About the program / oddities
Note: <br>
This app dont have auto save! When you have a .txt opened and you open another textdocument the text from the
first document dont get deleted. <br>
The txt files gets saved in the notes folder, which is located in the program folder.

# Keyboard shortcuts

**F2** Reloading the root-folder view (Its like pressing F5 in your browser, you refresh the root folder. The before opened folders get closed.) <br>
**F3** Saved opened .txt file <br>
**F4** Open the root-folder in the OS explorer (For manually editing and moving the files) <br>

# What features functions 
-Open up all files and folders in the folderview <br>
-Make new .txt documents and folders <br>
-Load up .txt documents <br>
-Save .txt documents <br>

# What needs to get done?
-Delete files and folders <br>
-Rename folders <br>

# Future plans
-Moving folders and files <br>
